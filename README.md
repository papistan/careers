## TECH STACK NOTES
I chose Gatsby for several reasons:
- Highly performant - prefetching, code-splitting by page, gatsby-image plugin, static site
- Benefits of React + Gatsby ecosytems (plugins and packages)
- Developer experience - components and flexibility with tooling and styling, great documentation, well-maintained project

## THINGS TO NOTE
1. I set enforeced breakpoints to keep consistency, since there is only one

## WITH MORE TIME
1. Find solution for font-specific bug on "TM" in firefox
2. Select menus - font size/color on active, find solution for react-select container padding
3. Fix padding between job rows
