## TECH STACK NOTESI chose Gatsby as the static site generator for several reasons:- Highly performant - prefetching, code-splitting by page, gatsby-image plugin, static site- Benefits of React + Gatsby ecosystems (plugins and packages)- Developer experience - components and flexibility with tooling and styling, great documentation, well-maintained projectFor styling, I chose to use SASS for readability, simplicity, and for being framework agnostic. I did not add for this project, but would normally add purge-css to reduce

## THINGS TO NOTE1. Padding and spacing were estimated anywhere explicitly state, for example, padding on sides. I would normally ping designer for these during development.

## WITH MORE TIME1. Find a solution for a font-specific bug on "TM" in firefox2. Select menus - change color on active, adjust react-select container padding3. Fix padding between job rows4. Audit for accessibility
