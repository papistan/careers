## TECH STACK NOTES chose ### TECH STACK NOTES 

I chose Gatsby as the static site generator for several reasons:
  - Highly performant - prefetching, code-splitting by page, gatsby-image plugin, static site
  - Benefits of React + Gatsby ecosystems (plugins and packages)
  - Developer experience - components and flexibility with tooling and styling, great documentation, well-maintained project
  - For styling, I chose to use SASS for readability, simplicity, and for being framework agnostic. I did not add for this project, but would normally add purge-css to reduce

### THINGS TO NOTE
1. Padding and spacing were estimated anywhere explicitly state, for example, the padding on sides. I would normally ping designer for these during development.

### WITH MORE TIME
1. Find a solution for a font-specific bug on "TM" in firefox
2. Select menus - change color on active, adjust react-select container padding
3. Fix padding between job rows4. Audit for accessibility
